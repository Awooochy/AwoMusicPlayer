# AwoMusicPlayer
A very lightweight music player

Theres nothing better than downloading all your music and being able to play it randomly, for finding again those awesome songs you listened in the past, having over 200gb of music and being able to swap between them using very few resources and fast responsiveness.
I lost so many songs I loved, thats why I'm not letting them pass anymore, I download every one I listen and like and place it in my folders, you can have them ordered by genre in their folders and play the whole folder with AwoMusic, or you can play all the folders and have a mixed sesion of music.

I'm working in adding a networked function for streaming music over other users with this app via p2p. It will be the 3.0 Update.
But I don't have enough knowledge.
If theres any devoloper out there willing to make this project truly what it could be. I would gladly take a hand for help.
Lets make a good lightweight music player free for everyone. In which anyone could be hosting their own p2p radio for free or simply users streaming local music with their friends.
